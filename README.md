### Hi there my name is Harrf Akbar 

## About 

I am a software engineer. I am currently looking to join a stable company that offers an opportunity for growth while continuing to contribute my expertise and experience to benefit mutual growth and success. I have 10+ years of managerial experience and I excel at taking on new tasks and responsibilities needed. I strive to adapt myself quickly into different environments and provide consistent results. My goals when building an application are to be responsive, dynamic, and efficient. I believe in a mindset of continuing education where I can strengthen my knowledge on new material for any project or language. When I am not working as a software engineer; I love spending time with my family and friends as well as my hobbies. I try to stay active by playing various sports such as football, basketball, and volleyball. I also enjoy camping and traveling, however my ultimate enjoyment is laying on the beach. Thank you for taking the time and learning more about myself and my work. I hope for an opportunity to discuss my further goals and endeavors with you.
